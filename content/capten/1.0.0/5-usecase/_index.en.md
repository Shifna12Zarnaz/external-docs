### Cluster Creation:

Developers use Capten to create Kubernetes clusters on a cloud provider of their choice (as of supporting  AWS or Azure) with minimal manual intervention. Capten leverages infrastructure as code principles to provision the required resources.

### Cluster Configuration:

After the cluster is created, Capten may handle the configuration of the Kubernetes cluster. This could include setting up networking, configuring cluster settings, and preparing it for the deployment of applications.

### Application Deployment:

The development team uses Capten to deploy necessary applications within the clusters. For example, they deploy Prometheus for monitoring, OpenEBS for storage, and Traefik for load balancing. Capten handles the deployment process, ensuring that applications are correctly configured and integrated into the Kubernetes environment.

### Dynamic Application Support:

Capten allows developers to easily extend the list of supported applications. If a new project requires a specific application or service, developers can integrate it into Capten's modular framework.

### Configuration Management:

Developers manage configurations through Capten's configuration files or command-line options. This provides a centralized and easy-to-understand way of defining cluster and application settings.

### Cluster Destruction:

Once a project is completed or a testing phase concludes, developers use Capten to destroy the Kubernetes clusters, freeing up resources and preventing unnecessary costs.

### Integration with External Tools:

Capten seamlessly integrates with external tools such as Terraform, Talos, Grafana, Loki, and more, enhancing the capabilities of the Kubernetes clusters.

### User Interaction:

Developers interact with Capten using its command-line interface (CLI) or configuration files. This allows for a straightforward and scriptable experience.

### Efficiency and Resource Optimization:

Capten ensures efficient resource usage by creating clusters on-demand and destroying them when no longer needed. This leads to cost savings and prevents resource wastage.
Documentation and Support:

The development team relies on Capten's documentation for guidance on installation, configuration, and troubleshooting. Community support forums and channels are available for assistance.
